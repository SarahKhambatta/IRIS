# IRIS
Basic ML model
The Iris Classifier built with Watson Assistant harnesses the power of machine learning to classify iris flowers into three species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica. Leveraging the renowned Iris dataset, this model has been trained to recognize patterns in iris flower features such as sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.

Watson Assistant serves as an intuitive interface, allowing users to interact with the classifier seamlessly. By providing input regarding the dimensions of an iris flower, users receive accurate predictions about its species. This model employs a variety of machine learning techniques, such as classification algorithms, to analyze the input data and make informed predictions.

With its user-friendly design and robust classification capabilities, the Iris Classifier is a valuable tool for botanists, researchers, and enthusiasts alike. Whether used for educational purposes or practical applications in the field, this model demonstrates the potential of Watson Assistant in deploying machine learning solutions effectively.
